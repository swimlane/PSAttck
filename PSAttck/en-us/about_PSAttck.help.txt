SHORT DESCRIPTION

LONG DESCRIPTION
    PSAttck allows you to interact with MITRE ATT&CK Framework. 
    
    Currently PSAttck supports the Enterprise MITRE ATT&CK Framework
    with future plans to support additional frameworks

    By default, PSAttck downloads data about the MITRE ATT&CK framework from
    an external source.  Additionally, additional generated data sets are downloaded as well
    
    You can set an alternate path to retrieve these data sets from by using 
    the Set-PSAttckConfiguration Cmdlet
        
POWERSHELL COMPATIBILITY
    PSAttck is compatible with Windows PowerShell 5 and PowerShell Core.

    PSAttck utilizes PowerShell Classes to generate and create standard objects
    across all ATT&CK data categories.
